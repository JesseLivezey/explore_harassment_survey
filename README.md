From: [Sexual Harassment In the Academy: An Anonymous Crowdsourced Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqWdpDxVRc-i8OiiClJPluIpjMlM41aUlU2E0rrQ4br_rQmA/viewform). By The Professor Is In (Karen Kelsky, Ph.D.)

Recently an anonymous survey has been circulating that asks respondants to give some information about moments that they've experienced harassment in their workplace. The results are being collected in [this public google sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqWdpDxVRc-i8OiiClJPluIpjMlM41aUlU2E0rrQ4br_rQmA/viewform).

This repository grabs the data from that google sheet and cleans it up a little bit so that you can explore its contents. Below are a few sections showing simple viz of the dataset to give you some inspiration, but there are certainly many more ways one could slice and dice this data!
